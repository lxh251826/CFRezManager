CF Rez Manager is a Windows WPF tool for browsing, searching, previewing, extracting, and packing LithTech / CrossFire `.rez` archives. It can also inspect loose resource files from extracted folders.

## What It Does

- Browse `.rez` archives, internal REZ folders, and normal resource folders.
- Search files, folders, and internal REZ paths with multi-keyword filtering.
- Export all resources, or only selected files, folders, and REZ entries.
- Pack a normal Windows folder into a new `.rez` archive.
- Preview images, textures, audio, models, maps, script configs, and common CrossFire/LithTech resources.
- Export recognized CrossFire image BIN files as standard `.png` files.
- Provide command-line batch entry points for OBJ/MTL model export, CFG scanning, and CFG decoding.

## Requirements

- Windows
- .NET 8 SDK or .NET 8 Runtime

## Build And Run

```powershell
dotnet build .\CFRezManager.csproj
```

Run the app from Visual Studio, or start the built executable:

```text
bin\Debug\net8.0-windows7.0\CFRezManager.exe
```

- `App/`: startup helpers, settings, localization, and assembly metadata.
- `Archives/`: REZ reading, writing, and directory-table encryption logic.
- `Commands/`: command-line entry points for OBJ export, CFG scan/decode, and standalone preview.
- `Decoders/`: resource decoders grouped by audio, images, CrossFire, LithTech, text, and related formats.
- `Explorer/`: resource browser item model and thumbnail cache.
- `Preview/`: standalone preview windows for audio, images, models, and text.
- `UI/`: main window and UI controls.
- `assets/`: app icon and image resources copied with the app.

## Basic Use

1. Start the program.
2. Select a folder that contains `.rez` files or loose resources.
3. Double-click a folder, REZ archive, internal REZ folder, or supported preview file.
4. Use the breadcrumb bar to move back or jump to a parent location.

Click `Settings...` in the top toolbar to open the settings window, where you can switch between `Chinese` / `English`, `Light` / `Dark` themes, and clear the thumbnail cache. The app remembers language, theme, view size, scan folder, pack folder, extract folder, and save location.

The search box builds an in-memory index the first time you type, then quickly filters scanned files, folders, and internal REZ paths. Separate keywords with spaces to require all terms to match.

Use the bottom-right `Size` slider to switch between list view and tiled icon view. Hover an item to see type, path, size, source, MD5, offset, and related metadata.

Common right-click actions:

- `Locate File`: jump from search results to the containing folder and select the file.
- `Copy Name`: copy one or more selected item names.
- `Extract This Item...` / `Extract N Selected Items...`: export selected files, folders, or REZ entries.
- `Decode BANK...`: export a decoded bank and raw FSB5 audio blocks.

## Preview Support

- Images and textures: PNG, JPG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, DDS, TGA, DTX, CrossFire image BIN, original-size preview, and previous/next navigation.
- Compressed resources: common LZMA-wrapped resources, with thumbnail badges such as `RAW`, `LZMA`, `DXT`, and `TXT`.
- Audio: WAV, OGG, MP3, and FMOD `.bank`, with waveform thumbnails, track list, playback controls, seeking, and dynamic spectrum display. OGG/MP3 previews decode to PCM before spectrum rendering so normal audio files behave more like FMOD BANK streams.
- Models and maps: LTC, LTB, LTA, DAT, and SPR, with thumbnails and standalone preview windows; SPR can autoplay animation frames.
- Text and config resources: CFT, FCF, FXF, FXO, NAV, APF, REF, TXT, selected WAVE resources, CrossFire UI script `.bin`, and CFG.
- CFG batch work: scan texture references, decode plain/LZMA/ENC/REZ-phase text CFG files, classify failed decodes, and render previews for binary RGB-strip CFG files.

Generated thumbnails are cached in the `ThumbnailCache` folder under the program directory instead of the current Windows user profile disk. On startup, the app tries to remove the old user-profile thumbnail cache; use `Clear Cache` in `Settings` after replacing resources to remove current stale thumbnails.

## Model Preview Controls

- Left-click the model viewport: enter free-look mode.
- Move the mouse: adjust the view direction.
- `W` / `A` / `S` / `D`: move forward, left, backward, and right.
- `Shift`: move faster.
- Mouse wheel: move forward or backward along the current view direction.
- Right-click or `Esc`: leave free-look mode.
- `Reset View`: reset the camera position and direction.

## Extract Resources

Use `Extract All...` to export every file from all REZ archives in the scanned folder.

To export selected items:

1. Select a file, folder, REZ archive, or internal REZ folder.
2. Hold `Ctrl` or `Shift` when selecting multiple items.
3. Right-click the selection.
4. Choose `Extract This Item...` or `Extract N Selected Items...`.
5. Select an output folder.

Exported files keep their internal REZ folder structure. Recognized CrossFire image BIN files are exported as `.png`; script or config BIN files stay as `.bin`.

## Pack Into REZ

Use `Pack Folder...` to create a new `.rez` archive from a normal Windows folder.

1. Prepare a folder containing the files and subfolders you want.
2. Click `Pack Folder...`.
3. Select the source folder.
4. Choose the output `.rez` path.

Notes:

- File data is stored directly in the archive.
- REZ directory tables are encrypted, and file MD5 values are recalculated.
- File and folder names currently must be ASCII.
- File extensions must be 1 to 4 characters long.
- A newly packed REZ preserves content and folder structure, but does not copy the original archive's exact byte layout, offsets, timestamps, or whole-file MD5.

## Command-Line Tools

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\CFRezManager.csproj -- --export-obj --root "F:\Game\CrossFire" --model "PV-AK47_Balance" --output ".\out\PV-AK47_Balance.obj"
dotnet run --project .\CFRezManager.csproj -- --scan-cfg --root "C:\Extracted\cfg"
dotnet run --project .\CFRezManager.csproj -- --decode-cfg --root "C:\Extracted\cfg"
```

- `--export-obj`: export LithTech models to OBJ/MTL, write a sibling `_textures` folder, and reference exported PNG textures from the MTL; diagnostics are written only when textures are missing.
- `--scan-cfg`: scan CFG files, extract texture references, and write TXT/CSV reports.
- `--decode-cfg`: retry failed CFG files, export recovered text or binary previews, and classify high-entropy configs.

## v1.2.2 Changes

- Fixed additional dark-theme white surfaces, including context menus, selection items, inputs, combo items, progress bars, and sliders.
- OBJ export now creates a ready-to-import model package: `.obj` references `.mtl`, and `.mtl` uses `map_Kd` paths into the exported `_textures` PNG folder.
- Optimized OBJ texture resolution with global texture indexes, model-texture CFG indexes, and model/texture path heuristics so UI scripts and unrelated texture folders no longer dominate lookup work.
- Added a dedicated CFG text decode pipeline for plain text, LZMA, ENC Base64, and REZ phase attempts; binary RGB-strip CFG files are detected early and skip expensive phase brute forcing.
- Cached global texture indexes and CFG config indexes per loaded resource tree so repeated exports do not rebuild large dictionaries.
- On the `F:\CrossFile\CrossFileREZBack\7.2.1` test tree, `ak47` OBJ export completes in about 2.8 seconds with 2 textures exported and 0 missing textures.
